- if there is a `*.` before domain when adding it as exclude it won't match domain without subdomain - e.g. it would work on `http://something.google.com` and `http://www.google.com` but not on `http://google.com` so you need to add domain without `*.` manually.
**you don't have to do this if you use Beta version of TM
